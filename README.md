# Formula 1 Project: Incremental Load with Python Notebooks

## Overview
This project aims to perform incremental data loading from a Formula 1 API into a Lakehouse using Python Notebooks. The process involves fetching data from the API, transforming it, and loading it into the Lakehouse, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Formula 1 API access

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Obtain access to the Formula 1 API and configure authentication credentials.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `incremental_load.ipynb`.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions within the notebook.
3. Execute each cell to fetch, transform, and load data incrementally into the Lakehouse.

## Project Structure
- `incremental_load.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the incremental load process.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `files/`: Directory to store fetched Formula 1 data.
- `src/`: Directory containing helper functions and scripts.

## How It Works
1. **Data Fetching**: Utilizes the Formula 1 API to fetch the latest data.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleans, processes, and structures the fetched data for compatibility with the Lakehouse schema.
3. **Incremental Load**: Compares fetched data with existing data in the Lakehouse, identifies changes, and loads only the new or modified data.
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensures data consistency and integrity during the loading process.
5. **Efficiency**: Optimizes the loading process for speed and resource utilization.
